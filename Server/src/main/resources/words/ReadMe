Adding file to this folder should automatically make server load it and clients to display it.
It must be named "categoryN.txt" where N is a number, from 1 to whatever.

StartUI class has variable "maxCategoriesToSendToClient" that specifies how many of them can be send to the client.
If there are more files than value of that variable then random categories will be sent.

Characters that can be used in the files are specified by the StartUI's keys variable.
But changing that variable to add support for special characters in undefined behavior.
Most likely UI will be messed up. If I have time I might fix that.

File format:
    First line of each category is its name.
    Each other line is the word that user can guess.
    Words can have spaces, upper / lower case letters are ignored, can't have numbers and symbols.
    So only upper/lower case letters and spaces.

    If there will be other symbols or special characters (not defined in StartUI.keys) user will never be able to
    guess that word.

    Words shouldn't be too long as that will also mess up client's UI. If I design the UI and don't forget I will
    update this file to specify what is the max amount of characters in one line.

    MAX RECOMMENDED LENGTH IS 18

Project specifies that only 3 categories must be selectable, but giving the server ability
to read arbitrary number of categories doesn't hurt.
